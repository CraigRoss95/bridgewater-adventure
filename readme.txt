About
------------------------------------------------------
Bridgewater adventure is game created by myself, Craig Ross, for my Organization of Programming Languages course at Bridgewater State University. The objective of the assignment was to create a text adventure game by demonstrating our understanding of C++ as an object oriented language. The game features the likeness of students and professors in the bridgewater state university computer science department as well as some special guests. Bridgewater Adventure received a 100 although I do not consider it to be a finished project, the game has some errors that are grammatical and bug related in nature and I would like to fix these errors given some free time. Maybe one day Bridgewater Adventure will receive a definitive edition, only time will tell.
